# Example Spring Boot Starter

This repository contains an example of how to build a series of 
Spring Boot Starters, using a Gradle multimodule approach.

## Notes

- It is advised that custom starters should use the pattern `<customName>-spring-boot-starter`, to prevent confusion with official Spring starters.
